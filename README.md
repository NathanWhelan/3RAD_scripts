# 3RAD_scripts
Data Processing scripts for 3RAD data using STACKS

Please read comments in the demultiplex_and_removeClones.sh folder. You will probably need to modify some files names, at the very least. You will also need to provide barcode files in the format needed for STACKS in order to demultiplex.

Clone filtering assumes you used a random i5 index oligo in library prep.
